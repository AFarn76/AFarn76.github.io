    <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I have been a licensed Massage Therapist since 1999, and during that time, I have held various positions within the massage profession. 
    These include massage instructor, director of career services, director of admissions, and spa team leader.
    I have provided massages in different settings such as athletic events, backstage at concerts, office, clinical and spa settings.
    I find my work as a Massage Therapist very satisfying, which led me to pursue further education. In 2009, I enrolled in Esthetic school
    and earned my Master Esthetician license. I currently work as a Licensed Massage Therapist and Master Esthetician in the state of Utah.
    Over the past 20 years, I have taken a wide range of continuing education courses that have contributed to my unique massage style and technique.
    I take pride in offering customized treatments that cater to the specific needs of each of my clients.
